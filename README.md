# OpenCashDAO

OpenCashDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) template, designed to empower stakeholders to influence the project's direction. It serves as a proposal and voting platform for the community, enabling token holders to vote on various proposals to modify the project's functionality.

- **1 DAO, âˆž projects**: A single DAO can control multiple projects.
- **Proposals and Voting by stakeholders**: Anyone can submit proposals and stakeholders/token holders can vote on them.
- **Upgradable Project**: Once a proposal passes, the project gets updated by either removing, replacing or adding functionality.

### DAO contracts

DAO is a system of 4 contracts where the Controller.cash is the main contract that is part of every transaction that happens in the DAO.

#### Controller.cash
The Controller contract functions as the control and storage hub for the DAO. It holds DAO's [AuthorizedThreadNFTs](#authorizedthreadnfts), [ProposalCounterNFTs](#proposalcounternft) and [MintingNFTs](#mintingnfts), [VoteProposalNFTs](#voteproposalnfts) and [TimeProposalNFTs](#timeproposaltnft)

Constructor:
  - `daoCategory`: The category of the DAO NFTs.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) NFT with authorized contract's locking bytecode as commitment from self | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to self |
| 1 | Any UTXO from Authorized contract | UTXO back to Authorized contract |


#### SubmitProposal.cash
Anyone can submit new proposals to the DAO, which can have one of three intentions: to add, remove, or replace functionality. Once a proposal is submitted, a timer starts (`voteWindow`), and the proposal is open for voting. The proposal remains open for a set period, after which it can be executed. Based on the number of votes, the proposal is either passed or failed. If a proposal passes (`voteThreshold` is met), it can be executed by anyone, implementing the new changes to the project. While the DAO's contracts are static, the projects it controls are upgradable in nature.

The proposal requires a `commitmentDeposit` to prevent spam and ensure serious commitment from the proposal creator. If the proposal passes, the creator gets back the commitment deposit. If the proposal fails, the BCH is sent to anyone who calls the `completeOrFail` function of the [ExecuteProposal.cash](#executeproposalcash) contract.

Constructor:
  - `minCommitmentDeposit`: The minimum amount of satoshis the creator has to commit to the proposal.

There are 3 functions in in the SubmitProposal contract:

1. **add** This function allows anyone to submit a proposal to add new authorizedThreadNFTs to the Project Coordinator.

Parameters:
  - `proposalScriptHash`: 32 bytes scriptHash of the new contract to be included in the project.
   - `threadCount`: 2 bytes thread count represents the number of authorizedThreadNFTs to be added to the project.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) from controller.cash | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to controller.cash |
| 1 | Any input from this contract | Input1 back to this contract without any change |
| 2 | [ProposalCounterNFT](#mintingnfts) from controller.cash | [ProposalCounterNFT](#mintingnfts) back to controller.cash |

| 5 |                        | OP_RETURN with the proposal data |
| 6 |                        | Change pure BCH |


2. **remove** This function allows anyone to submit a proposal to remove authorizedThreadNFTs from the Project Coordinator. In order to remove the threads, an existing thread should be used as the input.


Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) from controller.cash | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to controller.cash |
| 1 | Any input from this contract | Input1 back to this contract without any change |
| 2 | [ProposalCounterNFT](#mintingnfts) from controller.cash | [ProposalCounterNFT](#mintingnfts) back to controller.cash |
| 3 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) from the Project Contract | [VoteProposalNFT](#proposalnfts) to controller.cash |
| 4 | Funding UTXO | [TimeProposalNFT](#proposaltnft) to controller.cash |

| 6 |                        | OP_RETURN with the proposal data |
| 7 |                        | Change pure BCH |


3. **replace** This function allows anyone to submit a proposal to replace authorizedThreadNFTs in the Project. In order to replace the threads, an existing thread should be used as the input.

Parameters:
  - `proposalScriptHash`: 32 bytes scriptHash of the new contract to be included in the project. The proposalId of the contract to be replaced is taken from the authorizedThreadNFT included in the input.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) from controller.cash | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to controller.cash |
| 1 | Any input from this contract | Input1 back to this contract without any change |
| 2 | [ProposalCounterNFT](#mintingnfts) from controller.cash | [ProposalCounterNFT](#mintingnfts) back to controller.cash |

| 6 |                        | OP_RETURN with the proposal data |
| 7 |                        | Change pure BCH |

#### Voting.cash
Token holders cast their votes on proposals by submitting their tokenAmount to the [proposalNFT](#proposalcounternft). In exchange, they receive a [VoteNFT](#votenft), which they can later use to reclaim their tokens. Voters have the flexibility to retract their votes at any time, regardless of the proposal deadline.

There are 2 functions in in the Voting contract:

1. **vote** This function allows anyone to cast their vote on a proposal.

Parameters:
  - `voteAmount`: The amount of tokens to be committed to the proposal.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) from controller.cash | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to controller.cash |
| 1 | Any input from this contract | Input1 back to this contract without any change |
| 2 | [VoteMintingNFT](#mintingnfts) from Controller.cash | [VoteMintingNFT](#mintingnfts) back to Controller.cash |
| 3 | [VoteProposalNFT](#proposalnfts) from Controller.cash | [VoteProposalNFT](#proposalnfts) back to Controller.cash with tokenAmount (Equal to `voteAmount`) |
| 4 | Utxo to cast vote with tokenAmount | [VoteNFT](#votenft) of Vote to the lockingbytecode of the voter |
| 5 |                        | Change tokenAmount and BCH |


  - **retract** The Retract Voting contract allows anyone to retract their vote from a proposal.

> **Note:** When the proposal is being executed, the votes are temporarily locked in the timeProposalNFT so the votes can't be retracted during the execution.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) from controller.cash | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to controller.cash |
| 1 | Any input from this contract | Input1 back to this contract without any change |
| 2 | [VoteProposalNFT](#proposalnfts) from controller.cash | [VoteProposalNFT](#proposalnfts) back to controller.cash (minus the tokenAmount in the recieptNFT) |
| 3 | [VoteNFT](#votenft) used to cast vote | tokenAmount to the voteNFT provider |
| 4 | Funding UTXO | Change pure BCH |


### ExecuteProposal.cash

The ExecuteProposal contract allows anyone to execute a proposal. The contract ensures that the proposal is valid and updates the project's authorizedThreadNFTs accordingly.

 - **execute** The Execute function.

The ExecuteProposal contract allows anyone to execute a proposal. The contract ensures that the proposal is valid and updates the project's authorizedThreadNFTs accordingly.

There are two functions in the ExecuteProposal contract:

1. **execute** This function validates the proposal and ensures that the DAO and project contracts are correctly updated.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) from Controller.cash | [DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to Controller.cash |
| 1 | Any input from this contract | Input1 back to this contract without any change |
| 2 | [VoteProposalNFT](#proposalnfts) from Controller.cash | [VoteProposalNFT](#proposalnfts) back to Controller.cash |
| 3 | [TimeProposalNFT](#proposaltnft) from Controller.cash | [TimeProposalNFT](#proposaltnft) back to Controller.cash |
| 4 | Funding UTXO | Change UTXO |

ADD

| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 5 | [Minting NFT of the Upgradable Project](#mintingnfts) from Controller.cash | [Minting NFT of the Upgradable Project](#mintingnfts) back to Controller.cash |
| 6 | | [New authorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) to the Project Controller |

REMOVE

| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 5 | [authorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) to the Project Controller | |

| 6 | [authorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) to the Project Controller | [New authorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) to the Project Controller |

2. **completeOrFail** This function burns the timeProposalNFT and makes the proposalNFT immutable. It ensures that the proposalNFT has the votes and commitmentDeposit is sent to the correct party.
This function is called under two circumstances:
    - When the voteThreshold is not met, anyone can call this function and claim the commitmentDeposit.
    - When the proposal is executed, and all the threads are minted or removed already. At this stage, the timeProposalNFT has all the votes and commitmentDeposit.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) from Controller.cash | [DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to Controller.cash |
| 1 | Any input from this contract | Input1 back to this contract without any change |
| 2 | [VoteProposalNFT](#proposalnfts) from Controller.cash | [VoteProposalNFT](#proposalnfts) back to Controller.cash |
| 3 | [TimeProposalNFT](#proposaltnft) from Controller.cash | Commitment Deposit to the creator |
| 4 | Funding UTXO | Change BCH |


### Upgradable Project

The DAO is responsible for changing the project's functionality. It does so by managing the AuthorizedThreadNFTs that exist within the project's coordinator contract.

#### Coordinator.cash

In order for a contract to be upgradable and compatible with the DAO, it must fullfil the following requirements:

1. **AuthorizedThreadNFT**:The project must hold an AuthorizedThreadNFT with the following commitment pattern:
  - `category`: projectCategory
  - `commitment`: 39 bytes < proposalID >< threadCount >< scriptHash >

2. **useAuthorizedThread**: It must have a function `useAuthorizedThread` that can only be called when used with the DAO's [Controller.cash](#controllercash). This function let's the DAO to remove or replace the project's authorizedThreadNFTs.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) from Controller.cash | |


3. **call**: It must have a function `call` that let's the project to use the authorizedThreadNFTs with other contracts.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [Project's authorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) from Coordinator.cash | [Project's authorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to Coordinator.cash |
| 1 | Any UTXO from Authorized contract | UTXO back to Authorized contract |


### Cashtokens

The contracts talk to each other through cashtokens.

#### AuthorizedThreadNFTs

- **[DAO] AuthorizedThreadNFT**:
These are immutable NFTs that control the transaction's execution flow of the DAO. These NFTs exist as utxos in the [Controller.cash](#controllercash) contract.

  - `category`: daoCategory
  - `commitment`: 35 bytes
  - Allocates 1 thread.

- **[Project] AuthorizedThreadNFT**:
These are immutable NFTs that exist with the project's controller contract. These are responsible to manage the transaction's execution flow of the project.

The DAO is responsible to create/remove/replace these NFTs from the project's controller contract. Making it possible for the project to upgrade itself.

For any project to be compatible with the DAO, it must hold an AuthorizedThreadNFT with the following commitment pattern:
  - `category`: projectCategory
  - `commitment`: 39 bytes < proposalID >< threadCount >< proposedScriptHash >


#### MintingNFTs

The [Controller.cash](#controllercash) contract holds the following minting NFTs:
- **ProposalCounterNFT**: This NFT is used to create new proposals for users to vote on. Since each proposal should be unique, the commitment of this NFT holds can't as a counter which increments by 1 for each new proposal.
  - `category`: daoCategory
  - `commitment`: 4 bytes
  - `capability`: minting
  - 1 threads/utxos
- **VoteMintingNFT**: This NFT is used to create NFT reciepts for new votes, the minted immutable NFT is send to the voter, that can be used to retract their vote.
  - `category`: daoCategory
  - `commitment`: 0 bytes
  - `capability`: immutable
  - x threads/utxos
- **ProjectThreadMintingNFT**: This NFT is used to mint or replace the project's authorizedThreadNFTs.
  - `category`: projectCategory
  - `commitment`: 0 bytes
  - `capability`: minting
  - x threads/utxos


#### ProposalNFTs

- **TimeProposalNFT**: An immutable NFT used to manage the timing of proposals, this NFT is created when a new proposal is created. Initially it's used as timer for the proposal, but once the proposal is executed, it's used to lock the proposalNFT's votes and commitmentDeposit.
  - `category`: daoCategory
  - `commitment`: 29 bytes
  - `capability`: immutable
  - 1 thread/utxo for each proposal

- **VoteProposalNFT**: This NFT holds all the votes for a proposal, whenever a user votes on a proposal, the vote amount is added to this NFT. This NFT also holds the proposal's commitmentDeposit. This NFT has different behaviour depending on the type of proposal.
  - If the proposal is to add a new contract to the project, then the 
   nftCommitment must be of 40 bytes and holds the following information:
    - `category`: daoCategory
    - `capability`: mutable
    - `commitment`: `40 bytes <ProposalID (4 bytes), ThreadLeft (2 bytes), ThreadCount (2 bytes), ProposedScriptHash (32 bytes)>`
  - If the proposal is a remove proposal, then the nftCommitment must be of 6 bytes and holds the following information:
    - `category`: daoCategory
    - `commitment`: `6 bytes <ProposalID (4 bytes), ThreadLeft (2 bytes)>`
    - `capability`: mutable
  - If the proposal is a replace proposal, then the nftCommitment must be of 36 bytes and holds the following information:
    - `category`: daoCategory
    - `commitment`: `36 bytes <ProposalID (4 bytes), ThreadLeft (2 bytes), ProposedScriptHash (32 bytes)>`
    - `capability`: mutable

Once the proposal is eligible to be passed, the proposal is executed. During this process, the `threadLeft` is decremented by 1 for each thread that is minted, removed or replaced. until it reaches 0, at which point the proposal is fully executed.

During the proposal execution, the votes and commitmentDeposit are locked in the timeProposalNFT.

Once all the threadsLeft reaches 0, the timeProposalNFT is burned and the votes and commitmentDeposit are returned to the proposalNFT allowing the votes to take back their tokens.

#### VoteNFT
Each vote cast results in the issuance of a VoteNFT.
  - `category`: daoCategory
  - `commitment`: 12 bytes
  - `capability`: immutable
  - `breakup`: < ProposalID >< VoteAmount >
