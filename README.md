### DAO contracts

DAO is a system of 4 contracts where the controller is the main contract that is part of every transaction that happens in the DAO.


#### Controller.cash
The Controller contract functions as the control and storage hub for the DAO. 

Constructor:
  - `daoCategory`: The category of the DAO NFTs.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) NFT with authorized contract's locking bytecode as commitment from self | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to self |
| 1 | Any UTXO from Authorized contract | UTXO back to Authorized contract |


#### SubmitProposal.cash
Anyone can submit new proposals to the DAO, which can have one of three intentions: to add, remove, or replace functionality. Once a proposal is submitted, a timer starts, and the proposal is open for voting. The proposal remains open for a set period, after which it can be executed. Based on the number of votes, the proposal is either passed or failed. If a proposal passes, it can be executed by anyone, implementing the new changes to the project. While the DAO's contracts are static, the projects it controls are upgradable in nature.

The proposal requires a `commitmentDeposit` to prevent spam and ensure serious commitment from the proposal creator. If the proposal passes, the creator gets back the commitment deposit. If the proposal fails, the BCH is sent to anyone who calls the `completeOrFail` function of the [ExecuteProposal.cash](#executeproposalcash) contract.

Constructor:
  - minCommitmentDeposit: The minimum amount of sathoshis the creator has to commit to the proposal.

There are 3 functions in each Domain Contract:

- **add** The Add proposal contract allows anyone to submit a proposal to add new authorizedThreadNFTs to the Upgradable Project Contract. The proposal requires a commitment deposit to prevent spam and ensure serious commitment from the proposal creator. If the proposal passes, the creator gets back the commitment deposit. If the proposal fails, the BCH is sent to anyone who calls the `FailProposal` contract.

Parameters:
  - proposalScriptHash: 32 bytes scriptHash of the new contract
  - threadCount: 2 bytes thread count of the new contract

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT | DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT back to DAO Contract |
| 1 | Any input from this contract | Input1 back to this contract without any change |
| 2 | ProposalCounterNFT from DAO Contract | ProposalCounterNFT back to DAO Contract |
| 3 | Funding UTXO | VoteProposalNFT to DAO Contract |
| 4 |                        | TimeProposalNFT to DAO Contract |
| 5 |                        | OP_RETURN with the proposal data |
| 6 |                        | Change pure BCH |


 - **remove** The Remove proposal contract allows anyone to submit a proposal to remove authorizedThreadNFTs from the Upgradable Project Contract. The proposal requires a commitment deposit to prevent spam and ensure serious commitment from the proposal creator. If the proposal passes, the creator gets back the commitment deposit. If the proposal fails, the BCH is sent to anyone who calls the `FailProposal` contract.

Constructor:
  - minCommitmentDeposit: The minimum amount of sathoshis the creator has to commit to the proposal.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT | DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT back to DAO Contract |
| 1 | Any input from this contract | Input1 back to this contract without any change |
| 2 | ProposalCounterNFT from DAO Contract | ProposalCounterNFT back to DAO Contract |
| 3 | AuthorizedThreadNFT from the Project Contract | VoteProposalNFT to DAO Contract |
| 4 | Funding UTXO | TimeProposalNFT to DAO Contract |
| 5 |                        | AuthorizedThreadNFT back to the Project Contract |
| 6 |                        | OP_RETURN with the proposal data |
| 7 |                        | Change pure BCH |


 - **replace** The Replace proposal contract allows anyone to submit a proposal to replace authorizedThreadNFTs in the Upgradable Project Contract. The proposal requires a commitment deposit to prevent spam and ensure serious commitment from the proposal creator. If the proposal passes, the creator gets back the commitment deposit. If the proposal fails, the BCH is sent to anyone who calls the `FailProposal` contract.

Constructor:
  - minCommitmentDeposit: The minimum amount of sathoshis the creator has to commit to the proposal.

Parameters:
  - proposalScriptHash: 32 bytes scriptHash of the new contract

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT | DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT back to DAO Contract |
| 1 | Any input from this contract | Input1 back to this contract without any change |
| 2 | ProposalCounterNFT from DAO Contract | ProposalCounterNFT back to DAO Contract |
| 3 | AuthorizedThreadNFT from the Project Contract | VoteProposalNFT to DAO Contract |
| 4 | Funding UTXO | TimeProposalNFT to DAO Contract |

| 6 |                        | OP_RETURN with the proposal data |
| 7 |                        | Change pure BCH |

#### Voting.cash
This contract allows stakeholders to vote on proposals. The votes send their tokens to the [proposalNFT](#proposalcounternft) and receive a [VoteNFT](#votenft) in return that can be used to retract their vote.

- **vote** The Voting contract allows anyone to cast their vote on a proposal. The vote requires a certain amount of tokens to be committed to the proposal. The contract ensures that the vote is valid and updates the proposal's vote count accordingly.

Parameters:
  - voteAmount: The amount of tokens to be committed to the proposal.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT | DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT back to self |
| 1 | Any input from this contract | Input1 back to this contract without any change |
| 2 | Minting NFT of daoCategory from DAO | Minting NFT of daoCategory back to DAO |
| 3 | Mutable Proposal NFT of daoCategory from DAO | Mutable Proposal NFT back to DAO with tokenAmount (Equal to `voteAmount`) |
| 4 | Utxo to cast vote with tokenAmount | ReceiptNFT of Vote, to be used later to get back the tokens from proposal NFT to the bytecode of Input3 |
| 5 |                        | Change tokenAmount and BCH |


  - **retract** The Retract Voting contract allows anyone to retract their vote from a proposal. The contract ensures that the vote is valid and updates the proposal's vote count accordingly. The retraction process involves returning the committed tokens to the voter and updating the proposal's vote count.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT | DAO Contract's authorizedThreadNFT back to self |
| 1 | Any input from this contract | Input1 back to this contract without any change |
| 2 | VoteProposalNFT from DAO | VoteProposalNFT back to DAO (minus the tokenAmount in the recieptNFT) |
| 3 | RecieptNFT used to cast vote | tokenAmount to the recieptNFT provider |
| 4 | Funding UTXO | Change pure BCH |


### ExecuteProposal.cash

The ExecuteProposal contract allows anyone to execute a proposal. The contract ensures that the proposal is valid and updates the project's authorizedThreadNFTs accordingly.

 - **execute** The Execute function.
 - **completeOrFail** The CompleteOrFail function.

## Upgradable Contract

This is a single contract with the ability to call multiple contracts. The DAO controls which contracts are accessible by the OpenCash contract.

### Cashtokens

The contracts talk to each other through cashtokens. There are a few types in this system:

- [Controller.cash](#controllercash) holds [AuthorizedThreadNFTs](#authorizedthreadnfts), [ProposalCounterNFTs](#proposalcounternft) and [MintingNFTs](#mintingnfts), [VoteProposalNFTs](#voteproposalnfts), [TimeProposalNFTs](#timeproposaltnft)
- [UpgradableProject.cash](#upgradableproject.cash) holds the project's authorizedThreadNFTs.
- Each individual votes holds the [voteNFTs](#votenft)

#### AuthorizedThreadNFTs [DAO]

- **DAO AuthorizedThreadNFT**:
These are immutable NFTs that control the transaction's execution flow of the DAO. These NFTs exist as utxos in the [Controller.cash](#controllercash) contract.

  - `category`: daoCategory
  - `commitment`: 35 bytes
  - Allocates 1 thread.

- **Project AuthorizedThreadNFT**:
These are immutable NFTs that exist with the project's controller contract. These are responsible to manage the transaction's execution flow of the project.

The DAO is responsible to create/remove/replace these NFTs from the project's controller contract. Making it possible for the project to upgrade itself.

For any project to be compatible with the DAO, it must hold an AuthorizedThreadNFT with the following commitment pattern:
  - `category`: projectCategory
  - `commitment`: 39 bytes < proposalID >< threadCount >< proposedScriptHash >


#### MintingNFTs

The [Controller.cash](#controllercash) contract holds the following minting NFTs:
- **ProposalMintingNFT**: This NFT is used to create new proposals for users to vote on. Since each proposal should be unique, the commitment of this NFT holds can't as a counter which increments by 1 for each new proposal.
  - `category`: daoCategory
  - `commitment`: 4 bytes
  - `capability`: minting
  - 1 threads/utxos
- **ProjectThreadMintingNFT**: This NFT is used to mint or replace the project's authorizedThreadNFTs.
  - `category`: projectCategory
  - `commitment`: 0 bytes
  - `capability`: minting
  - x threads/utxos


#### ProposalNFTs

- **TimeProposalNFT**: An immutable NFT used to manage the timing of proposals, this NFT is created when a new proposal is created. Initially it's used as timer for the proposal, but once the proposal is executed, it's used to lock the proposalNFT's votes and commitmentDeposit.
  - `category`: daoCategory
  - `commitment`: 29 bytes
  - `capability`: immutable
  - 1 thread/utxo for each proposal

- **VoteProposalNFT**: This NFT holds all the votes for a proposal, whenever a user votes on a proposal, the vote amount is added to this NFT. This NFT also holds the proposal's commitmentDeposit. This NFT has different behaviour depending on the type of proposal.
  - If the proposal is to add a new contract to the project, then the 
   nftCommitment must be of 40 bytes and holds the following information:
    - `category`: daoCategory
    - `capability`: mutable
    - `commitment`: `40 bytes <ProposalID (4 bytes), ThreadLeft (2 bytes), ThreadCount (2 bytes), ProposedScriptHash (32 bytes)>`
  - If the proposal is a remove proposal, then the nftCommitment must be of 6 bytes and holds the following information:
    - `category`: daoCategory
    - `commitment`: `6 bytes <ProposalID (4 bytes), ThreadLeft (2 bytes)>`
    - `capability`: mutable
  - If the proposal is a replace proposal, then the nftCommitment must be of 36 bytes and holds the following information:
    - `category`: daoCategory
    - `commitment`: `36 bytes <ProposalID (4 bytes), ThreadLeft (2 bytes), ProposedScriptHash (32 bytes)>`
    - `capability`: mutable

Once the proposal is eligible to be passed, the proposal is executed. During this process, the `threadLeft` is decremented by 1 for each thread that is minted, removed or replaced. until it reaches 0, at which point the proposal is fully executed.

During the proposal execution, the votes and commitmentDeposit are locked in the timeProposalNFT.

Once all the threadsLeft reaches 0, the timeProposalNFT is burned and the votes and commitmentDeposit are returned to the proposalNFT allowing the votes to take back their tokens.

#### VoteNFT
Each vote cast results in the issuance of a VoteNFT.
  - `category`: daoCategory
  - `commitment`: 12 bytes
  - `capability`: immutable
  - `breakup`: < ProposalID >< VoteAmount >

### FAQs

#### How does it work?

After token distribution, which depends on the party working on the DAO, tokens are used for voting on proposals.

Anyone can submit a proposal by depositing a `commitmentDeposit` amount of BCH.

Proposals run for a `voteWindow` period, after which they can be executed.

If a proposal passes, anyone can execute and interact with the contracts:
- Add
- Remove
- Replace

If a proposal doesn't meet the `voteThreshold`, it can be burned, and the `commitmentDeposit` is sent to the party who burns the proposal. This mechanism prevents spam and ensures serious commitment from proposal creators.

Proposals can also be created by other P2SH contracts or contract systems where communities collectively fund a proposal.

## What does a proposal look like?

Once a proposal is passed, it can be executed by anyone. There are three different behaviors for a proposal:
- Add: An `Add` proposal mints new authorizedThreadNFTs in the `authorizedThreadNFTs` contract, resulting in a new contract being created.
- Remove: A `Remove` proposal burns the `authorizedThreadNFTs`, removing the contract from the `authorizedThreadNFTs` contract.
- Replace: A `Replace` proposal burns the `authorizedThreadNFTs` and mints new ones in the `authorizedThreadNFTs` contract.

#### What is the purpose of the DelegateNFT?

The DelegateNFT is used to manage delegates. It allows a user to delegate their votes to another user.

#### How does voting occur?

Token holders cast their votes on proposals by submitting their tokenAmount to the proposalNFT. In exchange, they receive a VoteNFT, which they can later use to reclaim their tokens. Voters have the flexibility to retract their votes at any time, regardless of the proposal deadline.

There is another NFT called timeProposalNFT, minted simultaneously with the proposalNFT. This NFT remains with the contract and cannot be included in any transaction until the minWait period has elapsed. Once this period is over, the proposal can be executed. Depending on the number of votes in the proposalNFT, the proposal will either be executed or fail.

Upon reaching the deadline, anyone can execute the proposal and initiate the process of minting, replacing, or removing threads. When the proposal is executed, the tokenAmount from the proposalNFT is transferred to the timeNFT and locked until all threads are minted. During this period, votes cannot be withdrawn. Additionally, the commitment deposit is sent to the proposal creator.

Once all threads are minted, removed, or replaced, the timeNFT is burned, and the tokenAmount from the timeNFT is returned to the proposalNFT, enabling withdrawals. At this point, the proposalNFT becomes immutable and remains permanently in the DAO contract, while the timeNFT is destroyed.

In the event of a failure, only a single transaction occurs because the minThresholdAmount was not met. Consequently, the proposalNFT is made immutable, the timeNFT is burned, and the commitment deposit is sent to the recipient designated by the transaction initiator.
